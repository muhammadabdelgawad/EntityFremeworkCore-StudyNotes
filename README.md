# EntityFrameworkCore-StudyNotes

This repository serves as a collection of study notes and example projects exploring the Entity Framework Core (EF Core) library. While the current example is very basic, the intention is to expand this repository with more complex and practical demonstrations of EF Core features.

## Features and Functionality

Currently, this repository contains a minimal "Hello, World!" console application.  Future additions will include:

*   Database context configuration.
*   Entity definitions and relationships.
*   CRUD operations using EF Core.
*   Querying data with LINQ.
*   Migrations and database schema management.
*   Advanced EF Core features (e.g., change tracking, disconnected scenarios).

## Technology Stack

*   .NET (Target framework will be specified in future updates)
*   Entity Framework Core (Version will be specified in future updates)
*   C#

## Prerequisites

*   .NET SDK installed.  You can download it from [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download).
*   A suitable IDE or text editor (e.g., Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code).

## Installation Instructions

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash

    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd EntityFremeworkCore-StudyNotes/EFCore
    ```

## Usage Guide

Currently, the application is a simple "Hello, World!" console application.

1.  Navigate to the `EFCore` directory.
2.  Run the application using the .NET CLI:

    ```bash

    ```

    This will output "Hello, World!" to the console. Press Enter to exit.

Future examples will demonstrate more complex EF Core functionality.  Refer to the specific example's README for detailed usage instructions.
