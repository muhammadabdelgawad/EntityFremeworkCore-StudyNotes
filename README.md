 ## 📋 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [.NET 10 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/10.0)
- [SQL Server 2019+](https://www.microsoft.com/sql-server/sql-server-downloads) or SQL Server Express
- [Visual Studio 2026](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) (recommended) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms) (optional)

## Installation Instructions

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/muhammadabdelgawad/EntityFremeworkCore-StudyNotes.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd EntityFremeworkCore-StudyNotes/EFCore
    ```

## Usage Guide

Currently, the application is a simple "Hello, World!" console application.

1.  Navigate to the `EFCore` directory.
2.  Run the application using the .NET CLI:

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

    This will output "Hello, World!" to the console. Press Enter to exit.

Future examples will demonstrate more complex EF Core functionality.  Refer to the specific example's README for detailed usage instructions.
